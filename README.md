### Introduction

A full-stack, real-time voting application for a professional business fraternity, facilitating a streamlined, real-time voting experience for Rush Week bid night, eliminating inefficiencies caused by manual and common Google Form processes.

### Problem

During Rush Week, 90–120 pledges (prospective members) are considered for admission into the fraternity. Historically, voting has relied on manually creating Google Forms for each pledge, which is time-consuming and lacks real-time monitoring. Key issues include:

- 🔍 No visibility into who has or hasn't voted
- 🧾 Manual form creation for every pledge
- 🔌 Disconnected user experience
- 🧠 Difficulty coordinating in high-pressure, real-time settings

### Solution

Develop a web-based, real-time, scalable voting application that simplifies pledge voting and increases transparency, accuracy, and speed.

### Roles

- **Administrators**: Users who create rooms, start and close votes, and monitor participation.
- **Participants**: Users who join rooms and cast their votes on each pledge.

### Features

- 🏗️ Room creation and invitation system
- 👀 Real-time display of participants in the room
- 🗳️ Voting initiation, active voting, and closing phase
- 📊 Live feedback on voting status (who voted, who hasn’t)
- 📡 Scalable to 90–150 users per room
- 💻 Mobile and desktop friendly

### Conclusion

By leveraging modern technologies and real-time architecture, this application aims to significantly improve the Rush Week voting process for the fraternity. The shift from manual Google Forms to a centralized voting platform will increase participation visibility, reduce overhead, and create a smoother experience.
